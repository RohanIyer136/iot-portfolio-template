# Reflection 2 in Module 2

## What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?Take-away can be small summary, but better outstanding points.
1. The exercises today reminded me of my physics basics learnt during my 8th grade >.<
2. Breadboard ≠ Paper . Drawing schematics was easy, but translating them to the breadboard slightly more complex. The breadboard has its own conductive logic, where only the columns are connected, not the rows.
  
## What was good?
Hands-On Exercises
  
## What was difficult, where did you struggle?
Why can a relay control a large current with a small current? Why does a locker locked when the relay is powered on?  

I think it would be a lot more cool if the question was portrayed and then we conduct our own exercise using the breadboard knowledge
After class, I looked up some materials and found the answer. It turns out that the smart lock uses this principle.

## Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors? 
we experimented with different resistor values to see how they affected the LED brightness. It was fun to visually observe how current-limiting resistors work in practice.

## How was your interaction with peers/instructors?
collaborative and nice and we could seee the thought process of other people.

## Help and extra work
  - Who helped you, gave feedback, was it valuable?

For now nobody for the help

  - Who did you help, gave feedback to?

For now nobody as of this time

  - Did you present, implement, made a PR, or fix something that was crucial for the class in itself?

For now now, nothing
