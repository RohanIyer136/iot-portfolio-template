# Reflection 3 in Module 2

## What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?Take-away can be small summary, but better outstanding points.
1. Comparison and Application Scenarios of Buses
2. How to use PlatformIO and other uses

## Describe the session formats
1. We learnt more about the microcontroller
2. It is becoming more interesting as time goes by. The mess-ups and the successes. I want to dive deeper into the topic of sensers
## What was good?
Creating a successful circuit for an LED blinking lights
  
## What was difficult, where did you struggle?
Certain aspects may require chatgpt or the internet for further research which can be great but also a bit more time consuming

## Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors? 
Experimenting with Micro Servo Motors. this device can translate PWM signals into precise angular motion (e.g., simulating robotic joints). This revelation sparked ideas for automation scenarios, such as smart curtain control.

## How was your interaction with peers/instructors?
collaborative

## Help and extra work
  - Who helped you, gave feedback, was it valuable?

I want to give a huge thank you to Ulno and Renato for their incredible patience and support.
  - Who did you help, gave feedback to?

  I was on the recently on the recieving end of this help and I also required a partner. Minnie Zhou helped for the lab and i was able to catch myself upto speed.
  - Did you present, implement, made a PR, or fix something that was crucial for the class in itself?

For now no
