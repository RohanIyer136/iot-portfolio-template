# Reflection 7 in Module 4

## What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?Take-away can be small summary, but better outstanding points.
Loved playing with RFID card sensor and understood the use of this. would love to see how to create a system which can decode and print the same details onto a new fresh magnetic card. it is illegal but understanding how it is done would be interesting.


## What was good?
new steps and a new partner nicolas who helped me understand this and print these values. this was interesting and i enjoyed doing this experiment 

## What was difficult, where did you struggle?
struggled to actually connect and create the circuit required for this to happen.

## Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors? 


## How was your interaction with peers/instructors?
it was nice to mingle with the peers and instructors and it was very interesting throughout
