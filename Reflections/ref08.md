# Reflection 6 in Module 4

## What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?Take-away can be small summary, but better outstanding points.
I gained a better understanding of common programming errors like null pointer dereference, divide by zero, and insufficient memory. These types of errors are quite common when working with embedded systems


## What was good?
Following the instructors' guidance was really helpful, as it made it easier to understand what needed to be done during the experiments. 

## What was difficult, where did you struggle?
I think there weren’t any significant difficulties during the experiments. 

## Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors?
