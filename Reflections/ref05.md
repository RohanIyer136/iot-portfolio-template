# Reflection 5 in Module 3

## What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?Take-away can be small summary, but better outstanding points.
1.Netbird has helped me understand how devices can talk directly without a central server. Decentralized networks is equivalent to a simpler IoT connections.

2.IoTempower works like digital building block which mean to change WiFi names/passwords via a command-line manage devices, menu, and build a mini IoT system faster.
## What was good?
the delivery of the lecture could be tough to understand as it is a bit too continuous and hence can cause a person to zone out.

## What was difficult, where did you struggle?
setting up the system

## Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors? 
nooooo, we don't have enought time to finish all the projects.

## How was your interaction with peers/instructors?
I would say not good. we wasted to much time and we depended too heavily on TAs and ssistance for step-by-step solutions instead of solving the problems ourselves. It wasn’t the most effective way to learn.
